## Bug reports

If you have a bug report, please file an issue. 
If you can send a pull request with a repro of the bug in the form of a unit test, please do submit that PR and link to it from the Issue you file.

## Guidelines for contributing

File an [issue](../../issues/new?template=Feature_request.md) describing your proposed rule prior to working on a pull request. This will ensure that the rule gets triaged and there is no duplicate work involved from an existing rule or another contributor working on a similar rule.

## Pull Requests

We love to get pull requests. If you have a bug fix to offer or a new feature (see guidelines above), please send us a pull request.
Prior to submitting a pull request, ensure the build and all tests pass.
Every new feature or bug fix should be accompanied by unit tests to cover your change and proper documentation.
